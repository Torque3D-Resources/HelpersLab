# HelpersLab v0.1 - Pre-Alpha Release
Very rough release of HelpersLab which is not cleaned and organized yet. The included functions do work but the scripts are badly commented and not optimized. It have been release mostly to allow testing of TorqueLab which depends on a lot of functions included in HelpersLab.
I'm planning to enhanced the HelpersLab scripts soon so it can be use for other developers projects needs.

## What's HelpersLab
HelpersLab is a collection of TorqueScripts function that have been written to make differents common Torque3D tasks simplier. It also provide some new scripted features that can be usefull for Torque3D developers. Some of those functions come directly from the Torque3D templates and have been added so they can be used anywhere.

## Instalation
Put the helpers/ folder anywhere in your script and execute call to the root initHelpers.cs file:
    exec("scripts/helpers/initHelpers.cs");
That's it!
